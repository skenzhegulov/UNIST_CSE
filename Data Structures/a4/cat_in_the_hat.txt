THE CAT IN THE HAT

Then our mother came in
And she said to us two,
“Did you have any fun?
Tell me. What did you do?”

And Sally and I did not
know what to say.
Should we tell her
The things that went on
there that day?

Well... what would YOU do
If your mother asked you?

Look at me!
Look at me!
Look at me NOW!
It is fun to have fun
But you have
to know how.
